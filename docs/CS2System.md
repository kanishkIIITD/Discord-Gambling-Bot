## Installation & Setup

### 1. Backend Setup

The system automatically creates the necessary MongoDB models:
- `CS2Case` - Case information and contents
- `CS2Skin` - Individual skin data
- `CS2Inventory` - User skin collections
- `CS2CaseOpening` - Case opening history

### 2. Data Initialization

Run the initialization script to populate the database:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/init_cs2_data.js
```

This will:
- Load case data from `raw_cases.json`
- Load skin data from `raw_skins.json`
- Calculate case prices and skin values
- Sync data to MongoDB

### 3. Discord Bot Commands

The following commands are automatically available:
- `cs2cases.js`
- `cs2open.js`
- `cs2inventory.js`
- `cs2stats.js`
- `cs2leaderboard.js`

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Adjust drop rates in `cs2DataService.js`:
```javascript
const rarityDistribution = {
  'consumer grade': 0.7992,
  'industrial grade': 0.1598,
  // ... customize rates
};
```

### Wear Distribution
Modify wear probabilities in `cs2DataService.js`:

  const weights = [0.05, 0.15, 0.40, 0.25, 0.15]; // Customize weights
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data not loading**: Check that JSON files exist and are valid
2. **Database errors**: Ensure MongoDB connection and models are set up
3. **Command not found**: Verify commands are in the correct directory
4. **API errors**: Check backend URL and authentication

### Debug Mode
