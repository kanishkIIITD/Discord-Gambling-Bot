Ultimate Roadmap 

## GTA RP Discord Gambling Platform – Ultimate Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for a real-world, production-grade platform. It emphasizes scalability, security, maintainability, and user experience. Timelines are indicative and should be tailored to your team’s velocity and feedback cycles.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Weeks 1–2)

- Define product vision, success metrics, and compliance boundaries (e.g., virtual currency only, age gating, Discord ToS compliance)
- Select technical stack:
  - Discord bot language (Node.js)
  - Web framework (React)
  - Backend (Node.js/Express)
  - Database (Mongodb, Redis for caching)
  - Hosting (AWS,  or serverless)
- Design high-level system architecture (Discord bot ↔ backend API ↔ web frontend)
- Draft UI/UX wireframes for all user-facing modules (dashboard, wallet, betting interface)
- Identify key risks and mitigation strategies (scalability, moderation, legal)

---

## Phase 2: Discord Bot MVP (Weeks 3–5)

- Set up Discord bot with secure token management and permission scoping
- Implement core event detection (keyword triggers, command parsing)
- Enable manual bet creation and resolution via Discord slash commands
- Integrate basic point wallet (earn, spend, view balance)
- Persist user data and bets in database with proper schema design
- Logging and basic error handling

---

## Phase 3: Web Application MVP (Weeks 6–9)

- Implement Discord OAuth2 authentication with secure session handling
- Build responsive web dashboard:
  - Display live and upcoming betting markets
  - Show user point balances and transaction history
  - Enable bet placement and resolution from web
- Real-time updates (WebSockets or polling for live bet status)
- Basic user settings and profile management

---

## Phase 4: Core Platform Hardening (Weeks 10–12)

- Refactor backend for modularity and scalability (service layers, API versioning)
- Implement rate limiting and anti-spam measures (per user, per guild)
- Add audit logging for all critical actions (bets, payouts, admin changes)

---

## Phase 6: UX, Security & Compliance (Weeks 17–19)

- Responsive design for mobile and tablet
- Add clear disclaimers, age verification, and compliance checks
- Implement anti-abuse features (duplicate account detection, suspicious activity alerts)

- Privacy policy and terms of service

---

## Phase 7: Testing, Pilots & Launch (Weeks 20–22)

- Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- Internal alpha with select Discord communities (gather structured feedback)
- Bug fixing and feature refinement based on feedback
- Prepare public documentation (user guides, admin manuals)
- Public beta launch with monitoring and support channels

---

## Phase 8: Post-Launch Operations & Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

- Monitor platform health (uptime, error rates, abuse patterns)
- Regular updates based on user feedback and analytics
- Expand event types, community features, and integrations
- Ongoing compliance reviews and moderation
- Plan for scale: database sharding, horizontal scaling, CDN optimization

## 6. AI Code Editor Prompt

Here’s a prompt you can use in your AI code editor (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.):

> **Prompt:**
>
> “Update our GTA RP Discord Gambling Platform codebase to enforce the following global UI/UX design standards:
> - Set the default font to 'Inter', 'Roboto', or 'Nunito Sans' with fallback to sans-serif.
> - Implement the following global color palette:
>   - Primary: #5865F2, Secondary: #FFA940, Background: #18191C, Surface: #23272A, Card: #24292F, Text: #FFFFFF, Text Secondary: #C7C9D1, Border: #3A3F44, Success: #27AE60, Error: #E74C3C, Warning: #FFD700, Info: #00B8D9.
> - Use 8px border radius for all cards, inputs, and buttons.
> - Apply vertical and horizontal spacing in increments of 8px.
> - Ensure buttons and inputs are at least 40px tall, with visible hover/focus states.
> - Adhere to accessibility best practices: 4.5:1 contrast, visible focus indicators, and keyboard navigability.
> - Use these parameters to update global CSS/SCSS variables (or theme settings if using a framework like styled-components, Chakra UI, or Material-UI).
> - Refactor components to use these theme variables and maintain consistency.
> Only update base/theme files and reusable components; do not overwrite business logic. Flag any areas where contrast or accessibility cannot be met.”
>
> “If any custom branding or logo is present, retain those design elements and harmonize them with the above standards.”
